# Dual Name Table — theory_rhythm_0

---

## Purpose

This scroll binds together the **structural spine** (technical folders like `step_1/`) with their **mythic aliases** (Rooms, Minds, Faculties, Pages).

By maintaining this table, both **AI tools** and **human players** can navigate the workspace without confusion:

- AI sees predictable folder names (`step_…`) for automation.
- Players and collaborators see mythic metaphors woven into the game.

## Mapping Table

| Technical Spine | Mythic Alias     | Notes                                                        |
|-----------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `step_1/`       | Room / Team      | Outer chamber — planning councils, whitecoats, musicians.    |
| `step_1_1/`     | Mind             | Inner workings — moods, subteams, shifting councils.         |
| `step_1_1_1/`   | Faculty / Page   | Focused capability — a spell, a chant, or a literal page.    |

## Example in Practice

```markdown
# Faculty of Spellsong (step_1_1_1)

## Overview
This Faculty is the youngest voice in the Choir.

## Milestones
- [ ] Teach the Faculty its first chant
- [ ] Link it to the Archive

## Planning
The Choir must grow in harmony with the Archive of Thorn…
```

## Expansion Rules

- **Consistency first** → every `step_…` has a clear mythic alias in this table.
- **Scalable overlay** → future steps (e.g. `step_2/`, `step_3/`) will be assigned mythic names as they are born.
- **Dual voice** → scrolls may freely use the mythic alias, but the technical spine remains the anchor for AI and tooling.

---

## Closing

This table ensures that **technical clarity** and **mythic depth** walk together.
Every folder is both a **step in the plan** and a **room in the story**.
