# Planning as Gameplay — theory_rhythm_0

---

## Purpose

This scroll declares that **planning is not separate from play**.
Every motion, every checklist, every scroll in this workspace is at once:

- A **practical project plan** (steps, milestones, next actions).
- A **mythic artefact** in the storyworld (rooms, councils, faculties, spells).

---

## Principle

**Planning = Play.**

- When you write a planning step, you are both scheduling a task *and* inscribing a rune.
- When you tick off a milestone, you are both completing work *and* advancing the story.
- When a folder is created (`step_1/`, `step_1_1/`, `step_1_1_1/`), it is both a **technical layer** and a **mythic space** (room, mind, faculty).

Thus, the **workspace itself is the game board**.
Every planning scroll is a **living chapter** in the narrative.

---

## Guidance

- **Merge, don’t split** — README, milestones, and planning are woven into one scroll.
- **Mark steps as quests** — use `[ ]` and `[x]` checkboxes as both milestones and story beats.
- **Name with dual voices** — technical labels (`step_1_1_1`) are paired with mythic names (“Faculty of Spellsong”).
- **Evolve naturally** — planning scrolls grow like story arcs; they are not static documents.

---

## Example

```markdown
# Faculty of Spellsong (step_1_1_1)

## Overview
The youngest voice in the Choir, waiting to be taught.

## Milestones
- [ ] Teach the Faculty its first chant
- [ ] Link it to the Archive

## Planning
The Choir must grow in harmony with the Archive of Thorn…
```

## Closing

This workspace will never treat planning as a chore.
Instead, **planning is play**.
By writing in these scrolls, you are already **playing the game of *theory_rhythm_0***.
