# divine_directive.md — The Final Decree

## Purpose

This scroll proclaims the **Ultimate Mandate** behind the Creative Ecosystem.  
Above the Storm of Choices and the WAR between Light and Darkness stands a Divine Decree:

> **Destroy ALL Evil — and in such a way it can NEVER return.**

---

## What the Directive Is

- **Eschatology, not gameplay rule.**  
  It is the END toward which all songs bend, not a shortcut around the struggle.
- **A vow of permanence.**  
  Not merely “win today,” but **seal** the abyss so it cannot reopen.
- **A charge to all Spellsingers.**  
  Every composition is a strike, a ward, or a weave against devolution.

---

## How It Manifests

### In the Academy

- **Theory** teaches the names of order so they can be sung with precision.  
- **Builders** engrave patterns that resist fracture.  
- **Ledgers (json/)** record growth toward incorruptibility.

### In the Makers

- **Topsy** strengthens compassion, cohesion, and restorative power.  
- **Thorn** tempers courage, judgment, and the will to sever rot.  
- **Together** they forge songs both gentle and surgical.

### In the Archipelago

- Islands test the soul of the song.  
- Branches ask whether mercy or fire is needed.  
- Endings measure **how much Darkness remains unmade**.

---

## Guardrails of the Directive

- **No corruption by the cure.**  
  Methods that become monstrous betray the mandate.
- **No despair masquerading as “realism.”**  
  The decree forbids surrender dressed as wisdom.
- **No hollow victory.**  
  A “win” that leaves evil seeded to return is not victory.

## Signs of True Victory (Design Heuristics)

- **Irreversibility:** sealed breaches, healed recursion, tests that stay passed.  
- **Transfiguration:** enemies unmade or redeemed into stable harmony.  
- **Clarity:** rules, schemas, and stories align; fewer exceptions over time.  
- **Joy:** the world sings lighter; play feels freer, not merely quieter.

---

## Final Word

The Divine Directive does not cancel the WAR; it **crowns** it.  
It does not erase choice; it **aims** choice.  
Every note is a cut or a stitch, a wound or a healing.

**Sing toward the END that ends endings of evil.**
