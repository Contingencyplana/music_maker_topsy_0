# central_premise.md — The War between Light and Darkness

## Purpose
This scroll declares the **central premise** of the Creative Ecosystem.  
It names the war at the heart of the three games:  
**Light vs. Darkness, Harmony vs. Cacophony, Evolution vs. Devolution.**

---

## The Premise Stated
- The world is not neutral.  
- Every rune, every note, every choice tilts the balance.  
- The Academy, the Makers, and the Archipelago exist within a storm where order and chaos clash.  

This is not a tale of idle wandering.  
It is a **contest of destinies**.  

---

## The Three Games in the War
- **Topsy** → The Nurture Pole.  
  - Players grow, empathize, and weave harmony.  
  - A safe garden where order blooms.  

- **Thorn** → The Trial Pole.  
  - Players test themselves against resistance.  
  - A crucible where chaos threatens and discipline sharpens.  

- **Harmony Archipelago** → The Storm Path.  
  - Every island, every choice tilts the war.  
  - Players walk the hinge between Light and Dark.

## Player’s Role
You are a **Spellsinger** in this war:  
- Every composition, every spell-song is a weapon or a shield.  
- Every mistake risks noise; every triumph births coherence.  
- Victory is not given — it is sung into being.  

---

## Why the Premise Matters
- **Clarity:** The games are not “sandbox only” — they are stages of a great contest.  
- **Resonance:** The polarity is not abstract; it is lived by every player.  
- **Momentum:** The war ensures direction; the games move toward resolution, not stasis.

*Thus the Central Premise is simple and absolute:  
there is a WAR between Light and Darkness,  
and the Creative Ecosystem exists to stage it.*
