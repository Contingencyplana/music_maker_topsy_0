# topsy.md — The Matriarch Pole

## Aspect

- **Nurture, cohesion, empathy.**
- The hand that gathers, soothes, and harmonizes.
- Symbol: **woven circle of runes**, glowing warmly.

---

## Projection in the Game

- **Music Maker (Topsy):**
  - UI feels soft, inviting, intuitive.
  - Errors resolve gracefully (warnings instead of failures).
  - Encourages exploration: “try it and see what grows.”
- **Artifacts:** `project.topsy.json` → a diary of saved works, each like a garden of runes.

## Projection in the Pantheon

- **Matriarch Aspect.**
- The **Mother of Harmony**, who teaches students to listen before they sing.
- Appears in stories as a **weaver of songs** — joining disparate voices into a single cloth.

---

## Player Resonance

- **Draws:**
  - Kids, parents, beginners.
  - Players seeking calm, safety, and expression.
- **Tone:** “You belong here. Your song has a place in the circle.”

## Future Expansion Hooks

- **Fracture Path:** Topsy may become overprotective → *smothering harmony*, where nothing dissonant is allowed.
- **Evolution Path:** Can expand into *choral leadership*, guiding larger groups and teaching empathy across divides.

*Topsy is the hearth of the Academy — the nurturing flame that warms, gathers, and sustains.*
