# thorn.md — The Patriarch Pole

## Aspect

- **Trial, sharpening, resistance.**

## Projection in the Game

- **Music Maker (Thorn):**
  - UI feels firm, structured, uncompromising.
  - Errors prompt correction (cannot advance until resolved).
  - Encourages mastery: “prove yourself, or try again.”
- **Artifacts:** `project.thorn.json` → a ledger of trials, each composition an earned blade.

## Projection in the Pantheon

- **Patriarch Aspect.**
- The **Father of Rhythm**, who insists that students endure difficulty to grow.
- Appears in stories as a **forger of steel** — hammering flawed notes into tempered chords.

---

## Player Resonance

- **Draws:**
  - Competitive players, mastery-seekers, perfectionists.
  - Those who thrive on trial and error.
- **Tone:** “You will struggle here. But struggle shapes you into more.”

## Future Expansion Hooks

- **Fracture Path:** Thorn may become cruel → *endless trial*, where no success is ever enough.
- **Evolution Path:** Can expand into *guardian mastery*, where trials are purposeful, sharpening students without breaking them.

*Thorn is the anvil of the Academy — the stern flame that hardens, tests, and forges.*
