# three_games.md — The Three Pillars of Creative Ecosystem AI

## Purpose

This scroll defines the **three flagship games** of the Creative Ecosystem.
Together, they balance nurture and trial (the twin Makers) with narrative depth (the Archipelago).

---

## The Three Pillars

### 1. **Topsy — Build a Better Girl (Music Maker)**

- **Type:** Multiplayer rhythm/creation game
- **Aspect:** Nurture, cohesion, continuity
- **UI/UX:** Empathy-driven, supportive, welcoming
- **Core Appeal:** Safe, creative sandbox for kids, parents, casual musicians
- **Artifacts:** `project.topsy.json` — saved compositions/projects
- **Commercial Role:** Broad entry point, especially for family and collaborative play

---

### 2. **Thorn — Build a Better Boy (Music Maker)**

- **Type:** Multiplayer rhythm/creation game
- **Aspect:** Challenge, sharpening, resistance
- **UI/UX:** Firm, focused, uncompromising
- **Core Appeal:** Competitive and mastery-oriented audiences
- **Artifacts:** `project.thorn.json` — saved compositions/projects
- **Commercial Role:** Parallel to Topsy, but with sharper edges and higher skill ceiling

---

### 3. **Harmony Archipelago (Interactive Novel)**

- **Type:** Narrative interactive novel
- **Aspect:** Lore spine, context, world-building
- **Core Role:** Explains the Music Academy, the Islands, the ghosts, and the pantheon
- **Appeal:** Solo players, story-driven audiences, lore-lovers
- **Artifacts:** `story.md`, branching choices, companion exports
- **Commercial Role:** Cross-media expansion (interactive book, novelization, IP building)

## High-Level Phasing Timeline

### Phase 0 — Foundation (Now → 6 months)

- Pilot chain: `theory_rhythm_0 → builder_rhythm_0 → music_maker_topsy_0`
- Golden sample artifacts
- Console prototypes → playtest loop proven
- **Milestone:** *The Academy breathes*

### Phase 1 — Pilot Games (6–12 months)

- Expand melody/harmony/form builders
- Upgrade Topsy + Thorn UIs
- Closed multiplayer playtests
- Draft Archipelago scaffold
- **Milestone:** *Twin Makers online*

### Phase 2 — Early Access (12–24 months)

- Complete 14 repos (7 theory + 7 builders)
- Networked multiplayer
- Archipelago framing story + TONS-of-FUN loops
- Publishing House integration
- **Milestone:** *The Academy opens*

### Phase 3 — Expansion & Federation (24–36 months)

- Expression + mix builders
- Expand Archipelago with branching narrative
- Add failsafe expansion hooks (Doctor, Timestorm, Ocean, Fortress)
- Kickstarter-style campaign (Tons-of-FUN AI)
- **Milestone:** *The Pantheon awakens*

### Phase 4 — Commercial Launch (36+ months)

## Why This Works

- **Balanced duality:** Topsy (nurture) and Thorn (challenge) serve different player instincts.
- **Lore anchor:** Harmony Archipelago ties them together without bloating the games.
- **Failsafe spice:** Expansion hooks keep boredom at bay.
- **Commercial path:** Early demos → Early Access → Expansion → Launch → DLC ensures momentum.
