# Chapter: Rhythm — The Pulse Room

The air is warm, the metronome gentle.
Here, the beat is an invitation, not a command.

**PLAY A NOTE**
1. Do — Breathe with the quarter notes
2. Re — Step lightly on the off-beats
3. Mi — Clap a playful syncopation
4. Fa — Rest and listen to silence
5. Sol — Weave a second line in harmony
6. La — Add a smile of swing
7. Ti — Lean forward into the next bar
8. Meditate — Pause, save, reflect, or resume

## Do
You breathe with the metronome.
The room steadies: **1 2 3 4**.

## Re
Your feet tap gently between the beats.
The floor sways with lift and release.

## Mi
You clap a playful skip; silence fills the gaps.
Laughter echoes in the pauses.

## Fa
You pause. The room listens with you.
Even silence belongs to rhythm.

## Sol
Another voice joins yours, weaving kindly.
Together you make space for each other.

## La
The beat relaxes—just enough to swing.
The pattern smiles back at you.

## Ti
You lean forward, arriving early,
and the bar greets you like an old friend.
